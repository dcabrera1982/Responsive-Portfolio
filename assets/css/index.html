    Born and raised in Orlando, Fl.  At the age of 18 I entered the Marine Corps and served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in 2003.  
    I'm addicted to sports and exercise having played baseball and basketball as a child and through high school.

    Spending time with my wife and kids is what I enjoy the most.  Having a 9 year old son, 2 year old son and 1 year old daughter is a lot of work.
    I wouldn't trade it for the world.
