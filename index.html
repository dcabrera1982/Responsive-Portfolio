            <img src="images/my-picture.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="David Cabrera">

            <p>About me: I am a devoted husband and father of three.
                Born and raised in Orlando, Fl. At the age of 18 I entered the Marine Corps and served in Operation
                Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom in 2003.
                I'm addicted to sports and exercise having played baseball and basketball as a child and through high
                school.
                I met my wife through my best friend whom is married to my wifes sister.</p>

            <p>I enjoy doing Crossfit as my exercise and competing in various athletic activities (ie. Basketball,
                Baseball, Crossfit competitions, 5k, etc)
                Spending time with my wife and kids is what I enjoy the most. Having a 9 year old son, 2 year old son
                and 1 year old daughter is a lot of work.
                I wouldn't trade it for the world.</p>

            <p>I am now attempting a new direction in my life in becoming a Web Developer.
                I want to be able to provide for my family while also having time to spend and enjoy with them.</p>
